## Key Concepts

- **Functional vs. Imperative Programming Tradeoffs**: All languages have pros and cons. Languages like C# and Java have runtimes (JIT - Just In Time compilation) making them cross-platform but slower. Need to weigh tradeoffs between languages that compile to machine code vs intermediate code.

- **Transpilation**: TypeScript is "transpiled" (when one language is compiled into another language) to JavaScript.

- **C Language Concepts**:
  - **Static Memory**: Need to review this concept
  - **Scope**: What can be seen in the current file
  - **Linkage**: What can be seen across multiple files
    - External linkage: visible to other files (default for global variables unless made static)
    - Internal linkage: links within current file (using `static` keyword)
  - **Static Keyword in C**: Used for internal linkage, not for making things "static" in the traditional sense
  - **const**: Used for immutability in C

- **Pure Functions**: Maps input to output only, NO side effects. All Haskell functions are pure - side effects are not allowed.

- **Haskell Characteristics**:
  - Statically typed language
  - All variables are immutable and cannot be changed (everything is like `const`)
  - Function syntax: `twice n = 2 * n` (can be called as `twice(5)` or `twice 5`)
  - Type signature syntax: `average :: float -> float -> float`

## TODOs

- Review static memory concept
- Review scope concept (understands but needs reinforcement)
- Look up what `static` means in C (or clarify if mixing with another language)

## Summary

Lecture on Functional vs. Imperative Programming, focusing on language tradeoffs and characteristics. Covered C language concepts including static memory, scope, and linkage (external vs internal). Discussed that global variables have external linkage by default unless made static, and that the `static` keyword in C is for internal linkage, not for making things "static" in the traditional sense. Introduced Haskell as a statically typed functional language where all variables are immutable. Covered pure functions (no side effects) and basic Haskell syntax including function definitions and type signatures. Noted that TypeScript is transpiled to JavaScript as an example of language compilation approaches.

## Questions & Things to Look Up

- What does `static` mean in C? (or maybe mixing with another language)
- What is the `average :: float -> float -> float` syntax in Haskell?

## Connections & Big Picture

This lecture builds on the foundational concepts of programming paradigms by diving into specific language characteristics and tradeoffs. Understanding compilation approaches (machine code vs intermediate code/JIT) helps explain why different languages have different performance characteristics. The concepts of scope and linkage are fundamental to understanding how code is organized and accessed across files in compiled languages. The introduction to Haskell demonstrates how functional programming enforces immutability and purity, which contrasts with imperative languages like C where mutability is the default. These concepts will be important for understanding the tradeoffs between different programming paradigms throughout the course.

## Important Definitions

- **Variable**: A value with a name (not just a name for a memory address)
- **Pure Function**: Maps input to output only, NO side effects
- **Scope**: What can be seen in the current file
- **Linkage**: What can be seen across multiple files
  - **External Linkage**: Visible to other files (default for global variables unless made static)
  - **Internal Linkage**: Links within current file (using `static` keyword)
- **Transpiled**: When one language is compiled into another language (e.g., TypeScript to JavaScript)
- **Static Keyword in C**: Used for internal linkage, not for making things "static" in the traditional sense
