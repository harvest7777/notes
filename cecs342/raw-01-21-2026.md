bigger ideas of today:
imperative programming is stick shift
- start car, go to gear 1, then 2 , then 3
- more control, might have older software

functional programming is automatic
- just go to my destination i dont care how we get there

procedures, functions, and subroutines are the same in programming
def: set of instructions with a name

we will reserver "function" to describe math though
