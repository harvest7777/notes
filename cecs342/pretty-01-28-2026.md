## Key Concepts

- **Haskell toolchain components:**
  - **ghcup**: Installer and version manager for Haskell toolchain (GHC, Cabal, Stack, HLS)
  - **stack**: Project build tool, manages dependencies using reproducible snapshots, popular for teaching
  - **hls (Haskell Language Server)**: IDE backend, provides type info, errors, code navigation via LSP
  - **cabal**: Build system and package manager (`cabal build` compiles, `cabal install` installs packages)
  - **ghc (Glasgow Haskell Compiler)**: The Haskell compiler, turns source into executables/libraries
  - **ghci**: Interactive REPL for GHC, lets you load modules, test expressions, inspect types
- **ghci commands**: All commands start with `:`
  - `:?` for help
  - `:load` to load a file
  - `:reload` to update changes
  - Then type functions directly to execute (e.g., `twice 6`)
- **Pure functions**: Everything computed from input → one output (no side effects)
  - Ternary operator in C is a pure function, similar to Haskell style
- **Conditionals in Haskell**:
  - `if-then-else` syntax (similar to C)
  - **Guards** (piece-wise functions): More idiomatic Haskell style using `|` conditions
    - `otherwise` is the default case (like `else`)

## Summary

Introduction to the Haskell toolchain and basic syntax. The Haskell ecosystem includes ghcup (version manager), stack (build tool), hls (IDE backend), cabal (build system/package manager), ghc (compiler), and ghci (interactive REPL).

ghci commands all start with `:` (`:load`, `:reload`, `:?` for help). After loading a file, you can execute functions directly.

Haskell emphasizes pure functions (input → output, no side effects). Conditionals can be written using `if-then-else` (similar to C) or more idiomatically using guards (piece-wise functions with `|` conditions). The ternary operator in C is a pure function, making it translatable to Haskell.

Example: `signum` function can be written with `if-then-else` or with guards:
```haskell
signum1 n = if      n < 0 then -1
            else if n > 0 then  1
            else                0

signum2 n | n < 0     = -1
          | n > 0     =  1
          | otherwise =  0
```

## Connections & Big Picture

Haskell is a functional programming language that emphasizes pure functions and immutability. The toolchain provides a complete development environment from installation (ghcup) to IDE support (hls) to interactive development (ghci).

The comparison with C shows how Haskell can express the same logic but with different syntax—guards are more idiomatic than nested if-then-else statements. Pure functions are a core concept that enables reasoning about code and avoiding side effects.
