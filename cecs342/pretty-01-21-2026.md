## Key Concepts

- **Imperative vs Functional Programming**: Two different programming paradigms
  - Imperative programming is like driving stick shift - you have explicit control over each step (start car, go to gear 1, then 2, then 3)
  - Functional programming is like automatic transmission - you specify what you want (destination) without caring about the specific steps
  - Imperative gives more control and might be used with older software

- **Procedures, Functions, and Subroutines**: These terms are essentially the same in programming - they all refer to a set of instructions with a name
- **Terminology Convention**: The course will reserve the term "function" specifically for mathematical functions

## Summary

Syllabus day introduction to programming paradigms. Covered the fundamental distinction between imperative and functional programming using the analogy of stick shift vs automatic transmission. Discussed terminology: procedures, functions, and subroutines are interchangeable terms in programming, but the course will use "function" specifically for mathematical functions.

## Connections & Big Picture

This lecture establishes the foundational concepts for understanding different programming paradigms. The imperative vs functional distinction is fundamental to computer science and will likely inform how we approach problem-solving throughout the course. Understanding these paradigms helps in choosing the right approach for different types of problems and understanding existing codebases.

## Important Definitions

- **Procedure/Function/Subroutine**: A set of instructions with a name. These three terms are used interchangeably in programming contexts.
