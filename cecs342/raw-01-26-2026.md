lecture Functional vs. Imperative Programming

big idea
- all languages got their pros and cons like c# java got their runtimes (just in time) so its cross platform but theyre slower
- obviously about weighing tradeoffs, hell probably talk about the tradeoffs of each type of language (like langauges that compile to mcahien vs intermediate code)

nice facts
- typescript is "transpiled" (when one language is compiled into another language) to javascript

int seven = 7;
static memory (need to rewview this)
scope is global (need to reveiw bbut i understand)
const for immutable in c , forgot about that, idk why i thought it was static
look up what static means in c or maybe im getting that mixed with another language
scope -> what can i see in my file

** global variables by default have external linklage unless you make it static
ok that answer smy question
- the keyword static is used for internal linkage not making things static
static int seven = 7;
linkjage -> if i have more files, what can i see across those? idk ths well
    - external linkage: other files
    - internal linkage: links within ur current file

i described variable as a name for a memory address but he describes it as a "value with a name"
***i forgot this : pure function = maps input to output only, NO sideeffects

haskell stuff
its statically typed 🤔
int hsi case the name seven is good actually, unlike with C earlier
** lesson takeaway, all variables in haskell are immutable and cannot be changed
seven = 7
assumes type to be what idk, type is num p => p
ALWAYS immutable variables, like everythign is const

twice n = 2 * n 
twice(5) or twice 5 outputs 10


what is that 
average :: float -> float -> float syntax?
all haskell functions are pure
side effects are not allowed
average as b = (a+b)/2 how do you count how many times this was called then?
