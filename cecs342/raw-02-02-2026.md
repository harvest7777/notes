we need to finish computing our current n before going to the next n


accumualtign parameter method to build up the result
goto in c

int fact_acc_tail(int n, int f) { // Tail recursion
start:
    
    if (n == 0) return f;
    
    f *= n;
    --n;
    goto start; // return fact_acc_tail(n-1, n * f);
}

this prevent syou from making the call again
o(1) space thsi time

you acutally dont write the goto, the compiler doeds it yitsel fby optimizing it

todo: look at those two c and hasklell files and look at teh comparison between c and haskell
also look at the fib numbers

lambda functiosn
\n -> 2*n
whatsa with the \?
bc it looks like lambda in greek
