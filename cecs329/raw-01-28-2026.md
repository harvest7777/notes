## Functions (as relations)

A **relation** from \(A\) to \(B\) is any subset \(R \subseteq A \times B\).

A relation \(f \subseteq A \times B\) is a **function** (a map) from \(A\) to \(B\) iff:

\[
\forall a \in A,\ \exists!\ b \in B \text{ such that } (a,b) \in f
\]

- \(\exists!\) means **“there exists exactly one”**.
- Intuition: every input \(a \in A\) must map to **one and only one** output in \(B\).
  - not allowed: an \(a\) mapping to **two different** \(b\)'s
  - not allowed (for total functions): an \(a\) mapping to **no** \(b\)

Notation:

- Write \(f: A \to B\) (domain \(A\), codomain \(B\)).
- If \((a,b) \in f\), we write \(f(a) = b\).
- The **graph** of \(f\) is the set \(\{(a,f(a)) \mid a \in A\} \subseteq A \times B\).

Sets associated with a function:

- \(\mathrm{Dom}(f) = A\)
- \(\mathrm{Cod}(f) = B\)
- \(\mathrm{Im}(f) = f(A) = \{f(a)\mid a\in A\} \subseteq B\) (also called range/image)

Quick examples:

- Let \(A=\{1,2,3\}\), \(B=\{a,b\}\).
  - \(f=\{(1,a),(2,a),(3,b)\}\) **is** a function \(A\to B\).
  - \(g=\{(1,a),(1,b),(2,a)\}\) is **not** a function (1 maps to two outputs).
  - \(h=\{(1,a),(2,a)\}\) is **not** a (total) function \(A\to B\) (3 has no output).

Common properties (for \(f: A \to B\)):

- **Injective (one-to-one)**: \(\forall a_1,a_2\in A,\ f(a_1)=f(a_2)\Rightarrow a_1=a_2\).
- **Surjective (onto)**: \(\forall b\in B,\ \exists a\in A,\ f(a)=b\).
- **Bijective**: injective + surjective (then an inverse \(f^{-1}: B\to A\) exists).

forking is illegal, a unmapped is illegal

## Plain-English cheat sheet (no math symbols)

- **Relation vs function**: A relation is just a set of ordered pairs, while a function is a special relation where each input has exactly one output.
- **How to read “(a, b) is in f”**: It means “f sends/maps input a to output b.”
- **Allowed**: An input can share an output with other inputs (many inputs can go to the same output).
- **Not allowed (forking)**: One input cannot map to two different outputs.
- **Not allowed (unmapped)**: If we say “a function from A to B,” every input in A must map to some output in B.
- **How to read “f: A to B”**: “f is a function with inputs from set A and outputs living in set B.”
- **Domain / codomain / image**: Domain is the input set, codomain is the “allowed output” set, and image (range) is the outputs you actually hit.
- **Injective (one-to-one)**: Different inputs always give different outputs (no two inputs collide).
- **Surjective (onto)**: Every output in the codomain gets hit by at least one input.
- **Bijective**: It’s both one-to-one and onto, so you can reverse it with an inverse function.

f(-1) is inverse
i pretty much get all this jsut gotta get familar with theterms


connecting it all: bijectiosn are important becasue....**

- **Cardinality (size of a set)**: Cardinality just means “how many elements are in the set” (for finite sets it’s literally the count).
we call it cardilanlity , we need to atlk about the cardinality for any type of sets, including ****INFINITE****, if any 2 sets have a bijection, we KNOW cardinality is EQUAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IMPROTant idea
- **Equinumerous (same size)**: Two sets are equinumerous if you can pair up every element of the first set with exactly one element of the second set, with no leftovers on either side.
- **Why bijections matter**: That “perfect pairing” is exactly what a bijection does, so bijections are the tool we use to prove two sets have the same cardinality.
- **Infinite set intuition**: For infinite sets, “same cardinality” does *not* mean “same largest number” (there isn’t one) — it means you can still make a perfect one-to-one pairing.
- **Quick example (in words)**: The set of whole numbers and the set of even whole numbers are equinumerous because you can pair each whole number with its double.
- **Big picture / why math**: Formal definitions let us prove things that *aren’t* obvious from intuition (especially with infinity), so we can know what’s true even when our “common sense” guesses wrong.

## Common number sets (from the board)

- **2N (even natural numbers)**: {2, 4, 6, ...} (just the naturals that are divisible by 2).
- **N (natural numbers)**: {1, 2, 3, ...} (counting numbers; note: some books include 0, but here 0 is listed separately).
- **N0 (natural numbers including 0)**: {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}.
- **Z (integers)**: {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...} (positive, negative, and zero).
- **Q (rational numbers)**: numbers you can write as a fraction a/b where a and b are integers and b is not 0 (includes integers too, like 3 = 3/1).
- **R (real numbers)**: all rationals plus irrationals (everything on the number line, like sqrt(2), pi, etc.).

- **Containment chain (smallest to biggest)**: 2N is a subset of N, which is a subset of N0, which is a subset of Z, which is a subset of Q, which is a subset of R.

## Example: same cardinality for infinite sets (N0 vs N)

- **Claim/Theorem**: The set of natural numbers including 0 (N0 = {0,1,2,3,...}) has the same cardinality as the set of natural numbers starting at 1 (N = {1,2,3,...}).
- **Function used (shift by 1)**: Define a mapping that sends each number n in N0 to n+1 in N (so 0→1, 1→2, 2→3, ...).
- **Why it’s a bijection (main point)**:
  - **One-to-one**: different inputs give different outputs (if you start with two different n’s, adding 1 won’t make them equal).
  - **Onto**: every number in N gets hit, because any m in N comes from exactly one input, namely m−1 in N0.
- **Inverse idea**: the “undo” mapping sends m in N back to m−1 in N0, showing the pairing is perfect.
- **Takeaway**: this is a classic non-intuitive infinity fact—removing or adding a single element to an infinite set can still leave it the “same size.”
