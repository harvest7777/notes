## Key Concepts

- **Mathematical Foundations Vocabulary**: Establishing precise terminology (axiom, definition, statement, proof, theorem, lemma, corollary) to avoid confusion when using mathematical language
- **Universal Quantifier (∀)**: "For all x" - if not written explicitly, it's assumed to be there
- **Set Theory**: Foundation for mathematical reasoning using collections of elements
- **Set Operations**: Union (OR), Intersection (AND), Set-Difference, Subsets
- **Powerset**: Set of all subsets of a given set
- **Cartesian Product**: Set of all ordered pairs from two sets
- **Relations**: Binary relations as subsets of Cartesian products

## Summary

Introduction to mathematical foundations and set theory. Covered essential vocabulary for mathematical reasoning: axioms (fundamental principles accepted as true), definitions (precise specifications), statements (propositions that are true or false), proofs (logical arguments establishing truth), theorems (proven statements), lemmas (helper theorems), and corollaries (direct consequences of theorems). Introduced three types of proofs: construction, contradiction, and induction. Defined core set theory concepts including singleton sets, union, intersection, set-difference, subsets, powerset, Cartesian product, and relations. Emphasized importance of precise mathematical language and notation.

## Important Definitions

**Mathematical Foundations:**

- **Axiom**: A fundamental principle used to define mathematical structures, accepted as true within a given system (e.g., "if x is even")
- **Definition**: A precise specification of a mathematical concept based on axioms and established terms
- **Statement**: A proposition that is either true or false
- **Proof**: A logical argument establishing a statement's truth
  - **Proof by construction**: Proof by explicitly building an example
  - **Proof by contradiction**: Proof by assuming negation and deriving a contradiction
  - **Proof by induction**: Proof via base case and inductive step
- **Theorem**: A proven statement
- **Lemma**: A technical helper theorem (another proof that's already been proven to help you)
- **Corollary**: A direct consequence of a theorem (a theorem with a very simple proof based on something you proved earlier)

**Set Theory:**

- **Set**: Collection of elements
- **Universal Quantifier (∀)**: "For all x" - if you don't write "for all", you just assume it's there

**Singleton sets:**
∀x. ∀y. x ∈ {y} ↔ x = y
(↔ means "if and only if")

**Union:**
∀x. x ∈ A ∪ B ↔ x ∈ A ∨ x ∈ B
(∨ means "or")

**Intersection:**
∀x. x ∈ A ∩ B ↔ x ∈ A ∧ x ∈ B
(∧ means "and")

**Set-Difference (Complement):**
∀x. x ∈ A \ B ↔ x ∈ A ∧ x ∉ B
(\ is set difference, ∉ means "is not an element of")

**Subsets:**
A ⊆ B ↔ (∀x. x ∈ A ⇒ x ∈ B)
(⇒ means "then, implication")
Examples:
- ∅ ⊆ B (empty set is subset of any set)
- A ⊆ A (any set is subset of itself)

**Powerset:**
A ∈ P(B) ↔ A ⊆ B
Example: P({1,2,3}) = {∅, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1,2}, {2,3}, {1,3}, {1,2,3}}

**Cartesian Product:**
∀x. ∀y. (x,y) ∈ A × B ↔ x ∈ A ∧ y ∈ B
(ordered pair)
Example: {a,b} × {1,2,3} = {(a,1), (a,2), (a,3), (b,1), (b,2), (b,3)}

**Relations:**
R is a (binary) relation between sets A and B if R ⊆ A × B
Example: (<) ⊆ {1,2,3} × {1,2,3} "less than"
(<) = {(1,2), (1,3), (2,3)}
Usually we write 1 < 2 for (1,2) ∈ (<), etc.
