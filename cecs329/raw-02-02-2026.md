## From board 1 — definitions and |N| = |2N|

**Theorem** |N| = |2N|

Proof: Let f: N → 2N, f(n) = 2n.

| n | f(n) |
| 1 | 2    |
| 2 | 4    |
| 3 | 6    |
| 4 | 8    |
| … | …    |

Then f has inverse f⁻¹(m) = m/2 ⇒ f is bijection. ∎

**Definitions**
- **Finite**: A set A is finite if |A| ∈ N₀, i.e. there exists a bijection f: A → {1,...,n} for some n ∈ N₀.
- **Infinite**: A set is infinite if it is not finite.
- **Countable**: A set A is countable if |A| = |N|.
- **ℵ₀** := |N| (aleph-null = cardinality of N)

**Theorem** |Z| = |N|

Proof: Let f: N → Z (or N₀ → Z depending on convention).

| n | f(n) |
| 0 | 0    |
| 1 | -1   |
| 2 | 1    |
| 3 | -2   |
| 4 | 2    |
| 5 | -3   |
| 6 | 3    |
| … | …    |

⇒ f bijection. ∎

## From board 2 — |N₀| = |Z| and |N₀| = |Q|

**Theorem** |N₀| = |Z|

Proof: Let f: N₀ → Z.

| n | f(n) |
| 0 | 0    |
| 1 | 1    |
| 2 | -1   |
| 3 | 2    |
| 4 | -2   |
| 5 | 3    |
| 6 | -3   |
| … | …    |

- f(n) = n/2           if n is even
- f(n) = -(n+1)/2      if n is odd

Inverse:
- f⁻¹(m) = 2m          if m ≥ 0
- f⁻¹(m) = -2m - 1     if m < 0

⇒ f bijection. ∎

**Theorem** |N₀| = |Q|

Grid: N₀ × N₀. Diagonal / zigzag enumeration over pairs (x,y).

Enumeration: 0 at (0,0), 1 at (1,0), 2 at (0,1), 3 at (2,0), 4 at (1,1), 5 at (0,2), 6 at (3,0), 7 at (2,1), 8 at (1,2), 9 at (0,3), 10 at (4,0), …

f: N₀ → N₀ × N₀

| n | (x,y)  |
| 0 | (0,0)  |
| 1 | (0,1)  |
| 2 | (1,0)  |
| 3 | (2,0)  |
| 4 | (1,1)  |
| … | …      |

(Idea: rationals p/q ↔ (p,q) in N₀×N₀; enumeration of grid gives enumeration of Q with duplicates — can skip duplicates to get bijection to Q.)

sqrt 2 is irrational so it is not in all rational numbers
why tho?
hmm
