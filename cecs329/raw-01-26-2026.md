The point of this mind map is so we arent confsued later on when e uses thsi as vocab so ill just get used to it
**Mathematical Foundations**

**Axiom**: A fundamental principle used to define mathematical structures, accepted as true within a given system.
basically like "if x is even"

**Definition**: A precise specification of a mathematical concept based on axioms and established terms.

**Statement**: A proposition that is either true or false.

**Proof**: A logical argument establishing a statement's truth.
- **Proof by construction**: Proof by explicitly building an example.
- **Proof by contradiction**: Proof by assuming negation and deriving a contradiction.
- **Proof by induction**: Proof via base case and inductive step.

**Theorem**: A proven statement.

**Lemma**: A technical helper theorem.
- anothe rproof thats already ben proven to help u 

**Corollary**: A direct consequence of a theorem.
- a theorem that got a very simple proof based on somethign you proved earlier

lemma to prove tehorem, you see the theorem and yous ee that x y z are also true so those are corollaries (obvious consequences/side effects)

defs:
set - collection of elements
mathmeticians use sets 
arrow one ways is implication

**Set Theory Definitions**

∀x.  => "for all x", if you dont wirt ethe for all u just assume its there

**Singleton sets**
∀x. ∀y. x ∈ {y} ↔ x = y
(↔ means "if and only if")

**Union**
∀x. x ∈ A ∪ B ↔ x ∈ A ∨ x ∈ B
(∨ means "or")

**Intersection**
∀x. x ∈ A ∩ B ↔ x ∈ A ∧ x ∈ B
(∧ means "and")

**Set-Difference** (Complement)
∀x. x ∈ A \ B ↔ x ∈ A ∧ x ∉ B
(\ is set difference, ∉ means "is not an element of")

**Subsets**
A ⊆ B ↔ (∀x. x ∈ A ⇒ x ∈ B)
(⇒ means "then, implication")
Examples:
- ∅ ⊆ B (empty set is subset of any set)
- A ⊆ A (any set is subset of itself)

**Powerset**
A ∈ P(B) ↔ A ⊆ B
Example: P({1,2,3}) = {∅, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1,2}, {2,3}, {1,3}, {1,2,3}}

**Cartesian Product**
∀x. ∀y. (x,y) ∈ A × B ↔ x ∈ A ∧ y ∈ B
(ordered pair)
Example: {a,b} × {1,2,3} = {(a,1), (a,2), (a,3), (b,1), (b,2), (b,3)}

**Relations**
R is a (binary) relation between sets A and B if R ⊆ A × B
Example: (<) ⊆ {1,2,3} × {1,2,3} "less than"
(<) = {(1,2), (1,3), (2,3)}
Usually we write 1 < 2 for (1,2) ∈ (<), etc.
