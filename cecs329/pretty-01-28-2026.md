## Key Concepts

- **Functions as relations**: A function \(f: A \to B\) is a relation \(f \subseteq A \times B\) where every input in \(A\) maps to exactly one output in \(B\).
- **“Allowed vs not allowed” for functions**:
  - Allowed: many different inputs can map to the same output.
  - Not allowed (forking): one input mapping to two different outputs.
  - Not allowed (unmapped): an input in the domain having no output (when we mean a total function \(A \to B\)).
- **Reading function notation**: \((a,b)\in f\) means “\(f\) maps \(a\) to \(b\),” and we write that as \(f(a)=b\).
- **Domain / codomain / image**: domain = input set, codomain = allowed output set, image (range) = outputs that actually occur.
- **Injective / surjective / bijective**:
  - Injective: different inputs never collide (different inputs give different outputs).
  - Surjective: every element in the codomain is hit by some input.
  - Bijective: both; gives a perfect pairing between the two sets and has an inverse.
- **Cardinality & equinumerous**: “Same size” for sets means there is a bijection between them; this is especially important for infinite sets where intuition can be misleading.
- **Standard number sets**: \(2\mathbb{N}\), \(\mathbb{N}\), \(\mathbb{N}_0\), \(\mathbb{Z}\), \(\mathbb{Q}\), \(\mathbb{R}\) and the containment chain \(2\mathbb{N} \subseteq \mathbb{N} \subseteq \mathbb{N}_0 \subseteq \mathbb{Z} \subseteq \mathbb{Q} \subseteq \mathbb{R}\).
- **Classic example of equal infinite size**: \(\mathbb{N}_0\) and \(\mathbb{N}\) have the same cardinality via the “shift by 1” bijection \(n \mapsto n+1\).

## TODOs

- Get comfortable with the vocabulary: domain/codomain/image, injective/surjective/bijective, cardinality/equinumerous.

## Summary

We defined functions formally as special relations: a function from \(A\) to \(B\) is a set of ordered pairs where each input in \(A\) has exactly one output in \(B\) (no “forking” and no missing mappings). We practiced reading function notation, identified domain/codomain/image, and reviewed injective, surjective, and bijective functions (and why bijections have inverses). We then connected bijections to cardinality (set “size”), emphasizing that for infinite sets the right notion of “same size” is “can be perfectly paired,” and used the shift map \(n \mapsto n+1\) to show \(\mathbb{N}_0\) and \(\mathbb{N}\) are equinumerous. Finally, we reviewed common number sets (\(2\mathbb{N}, \mathbb{N}, \mathbb{N}_0, \mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{R}\)) and their containment chain.

## Connections & Big Picture

- Formal math definitions help us prove truths even when intuition fails (especially with infinity and “size” of sets).
- Functions are the core “mapping” idea used throughout math and computer science; thinking of them as relations makes the rules (exactly one output per input) precise.
- Bijections are the key tool for comparing sizes of sets (finite or infinite) because they express a perfect one-to-one pairing.

## Important Definitions

- **Relation (from \(A\) to \(B\))**: any subset of \(A \times B\).
- **Function (from \(A\) to \(B\))**: a relation where every \(a \in A\) maps to exactly one \(b \in B\).
- **Graph of a function**: the set of pairs \((a, f(a))\) for inputs \(a\) in the domain.
- **Domain / codomain / image**: input set / allowed output set / outputs that actually occur.
- **Injective (one-to-one)**: no two different inputs share the same output.
- **Surjective (onto)**: every element of the codomain is hit by at least one input.
- **Bijective**: both injective and surjective; supports an inverse function.
- **Inverse function**: the “undo” mapping that reverses a bijection.
- **Cardinality**: the size of a set (count for finite sets; for infinite sets we compare via bijections).
- **Equinumerous**: two sets that have the same cardinality (there exists a bijection between them).
- **Common number sets**:
  - \(2\mathbb{N}\): even natural numbers \(\{2,4,6,\dots\}\)
  - \(\mathbb{N}\): natural numbers \(\{1,2,3,\dots\}\)
  - \(\mathbb{N}_0\): natural numbers including 0 \(\{0,1,2,3,\dots\}\)
  - \(\mathbb{Z}\): integers \(\{\dots,-2,-1,0,1,2,\dots\}\)
  - \(\mathbb{Q}\): rationals (fractions \(a/b\) with integers \(a,b\) and \(b\neq 0\))
  - \(\mathbb{R}\): reals (all points on the number line)
