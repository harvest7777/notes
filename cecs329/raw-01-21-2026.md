how would you know what strings are allowed in python for example?
connection to formal language: a set of all strings

there are many ways to describe formal languages like recursively enumerable, context senstiive, ocntext fee, regular languages (type 0 to type 3)

- idk what these types really mean tho why are they even significant?

computability is basically waht a turing machine can and can not do 

p np is a bunch of languages? hmm
P vs NP asks a very precise question:

If a computer can verify a solution quickly, can it also find that solution quickly?

No one knows the answer. That’s why it’s one of the biggest open problems in computer science.

The two classes
P — “solvable fast”

Problems where a deterministic algorithm can find a solution in polynomial time.

Examples:

Sorting a list

Shortest path in a graph

Matrix multiplication

“Polynomial time” matters because it scales. Exponential doesn’t.

NP — “verifiable fast”

Problems where:

Finding a solution might be hard

But if someone hands you a candidate solution, you can check it quickly

Examples:

Sudoku (general case)

Traveling Salesperson (decision version)

Boolean satisfiability (SAT)

Key idea:

Checking is easy, finding might not be

The actual question

Is P = NP?

That would mean:

Every problem whose solution can be verified quickly

Can also be solved quickly

Most experts believe:

P ≠ NP

But belief is not proof.

NEED TO KNWO: why do we call big o? what is the improtance of saying oh of n isntead of just n?

need to know set theory (relations, functions, cardinaltiy)
ngl i dont konw these that well so i wll have to review. will need clarifying questions on this
