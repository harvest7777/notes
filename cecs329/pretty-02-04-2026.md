## Key Concepts

- **Enumeration of A**: A function S: ℕ → A that is surjective. Equivalently, a way to list (possibly with repeats) every element of A using natural numbers 1, 2, 3, …; every element of A appears as S(n) for some n.
- **Surjective (onto)**: Every element of the codomain is hit at least once. f: A → B is surjective iff (∀b ∈ B)(∃a ∈ A) f(a) = b.
- **Theorem (Cantor): |ℕ| < |ℝ|**  
  To show this, show that no function from ℕ to ℝ (or from ℕ to [0,1]) is surjective. So the reals cannot be enumerated by the naturals—both are infinite but ℝ has strictly larger cardinality.
- **[0,1]**: The set { x ∈ ℝ | 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 }; a subset of ℝ. Proving |ℕ| < |[0,1]| implies |ℕ| < |ℝ|.
- **Cantor’s diagonal argument (reals)**: Assume S: ℕ → [0,1] is an enumeration. List f(n) in binary as rows; build x by flipping the nth bit of f(n) for each n. Then x ∈ [0,1] but x ≠ f(n) for all n ⇒ contradiction. So no enumeration exists.
- **BIG idea (diagonal proofs):** DIAGONAL → FLIP → CONTRADICTION.
- **Cantor’s Theorem (general):** For every set A, |A| < |𝒫(A)|.  
  **Proof:** Assume f: A → 𝒫(A) is a bijection. Let D = { x ∈ A | x ∉ f(x) }. Then ∀x, x ∈ D ⟺ x ∉ f(x) (diagonal + flip). By surjectivity, ∃a, f(a) = D. Then a ∈ f(a) ⟺ a ∉ f(a) ⇒ contradiction.
- **Finite automata (started):** M₁ accepts exactly the language of strings that contain two consecutive 1s (substring "11"). Input: finite string; output: Accept or Reject; computation: start at start state, follow transitions on each symbol; accept iff you end in an accept state.

## Summary

We defined **enumerations**: a function S: ℕ → A that is surjective, i.e. a listing of A (with repeats allowed) using the naturals. We stated **Cantor’s theorem |ℕ| < |ℝ|** and proved it by **diagonalization**: assume an enumeration f: ℕ → [0,1], list f(n) in binary, build x by flipping the nth bit of f(n); then x is in [0,1] but not equal to any f(n), so no enumeration exists. We noted that [0,1] ⊆ ℝ, so this shows the reals have strictly larger cardinality than ℕ—“more infinite.” We then proved **Cantor’s theorem in general**: for any set A, |A| < |𝒫(A)|, using the same idea: define D = { x ∈ A | x ∉ f(x) }, then D cannot equal f(a) for any a. The **big idea** is DIAGONAL → FLIP → CONTRADICTION. We started **finite automata**: M₁ that accepts exactly strings containing the substring "11" (two consecutive 1s).

## Connections & Big Picture

- Uncountability of ℝ (and of 𝒫(ℕ)) is the basis for showing that many sets (e.g. languages, functions ℕ → {0,1}) cannot be “listed” or enumerated by algorithms—leading to undecidability and non-computability.
- The same diagonal + flip idea appears for |ℕ| < |[0,1]| (binary digits) and for |A| < |𝒫(A)| (membership in f(x)); recognizing this pattern helps with other diagonal arguments later.
