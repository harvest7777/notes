## Key Concepts

- **Cardinality via bijections**: Two sets have the same cardinality iff there exists a bijection between them. For infinite sets, this is how we define “same size.”
- **\(|\mathbb{N}| = |2\mathbb{N}|\)**: The evens are “as many” as the naturals via \(f(n) = 2n\) with inverse \(f^{-1}(m) = m/2\).
- **\(|\mathbb{N}_0| = |\mathbb{Z}|\)** (or \(|\mathbb{N}| = |\mathbb{Z}|\)): Integers are countable. Bijection: even \(n \mapsto n/2\), odd \(n \mapsto -(n+1)/2\); inverse: \(m \geq 0 \mapsto 2m\), \(m < 0 \mapsto -2m-1\).
- **\(|\mathbb{N}_0| = |\mathbb{Q}|\)**: Rationals are countable. Enumerate \(\mathbb{N}_0 \times \mathbb{N}_0\) by a diagonal/zigzag path; each rational \(p/q\) corresponds to a pair \((p,q)\) (with duplicates that can be skipped to get a bijection to \(\mathbb{Q}\)).
- **Finite / infinite / countable**: Finite = bijection to \(\{1,\dots,n\}\) for some \(n \in \mathbb{N}_0\); infinite = not finite; countable = same cardinality as \(\mathbb{N}\).
- **\(\aleph_0\)**: \(\aleph_0 := |\mathbb{N}|\) (aleph-null).

## Summary

We proved that several infinite sets have the same cardinality as \(\mathbb{N}\): the evens \(2\mathbb{N}\) (via \(n \mapsto 2n\)), the integers \(\mathbb{Z}\) (via a zigzag 0, 1, -1, 2, -2, …), and the rationals \(\mathbb{Q}\) (by enumerating \(\mathbb{N}_0 \times \mathbb{N}_0\) in a diagonal pattern and associating rationals to pairs). We defined finite sets (bijection to \(\{1,\dots,n\}\)), infinite (not finite), countable (\(|\cdot| = |\mathbb{N}|\)), and \(\aleph_0 = |\mathbb{N}|\). The main technique was constructing explicit bijections (and their inverses) to show equinumerosity.

## Questions & Things to Look Up

- Why is \(\sqrt{2}\) irrational (and hence not in \(\mathbb{Q}\))? (Proof that \(\sqrt{2} \notin \mathbb{Q}\).)

---

## Connections & Big Picture

- Countability of \(\mathbb{Z}\) and \(\mathbb{Q}\) shows that “size” for infinite sets is not the same as “subset”: \(\mathbb{N} \subseteq \mathbb{Z} \subseteq \mathbb{Q}\) but \(|\mathbb{N}| = |\mathbb{Z}| = |\mathbb{Q}|\).
- The diagonal enumeration of \(\mathbb{N}_0 \times \mathbb{N}_0\) is a standard way to show that a countable union of countable sets (or a countable “grid”) is still countable.
- \(\mathbb{R}\) is not countable (Cantor’s argument); \(\mathbb{Q}\) is countable, so “most” reals are irrational—connects to the note that \(\sqrt{2}\) is irrational.

## Important Definitions

- **Finite (set)**: \(A\) is finite if \(|A| \in \mathbb{N}_0\), i.e. there is a bijection \(f : A \to \{1,\dots,n\}\) for some \(n \in \mathbb{N}_0\).
- **Infinite (set)**: \(A\) is infinite if it is not finite.
- **Countable (set)**: \(A\) is countable if \(|A| = |\mathbb{N}|\) (i.e. there is a bijection from \(A\) to \(\mathbb{N}\)).
- **\(\aleph_0\)**: \(\aleph_0 := |\mathbb{N}|\) (the cardinality of the natural numbers).
