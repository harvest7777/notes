# Class Notes Processing Rules

## Template Structure
**IMPORTANT: The template structure is defined in `template.md`. Always refer to and follow that file exactly.**

When creating or cleaning up class notes, follow the exact section order from `template.md`:
1. Key Concepts
2. TODOs
3. Summary
4. Review Questions
5. Questions & Things to Look Up
6. Connections & Big Picture
7. Important Definitions

## File Organization
- Course code goes in folder name (e.g., `cecs381/`)
- Date goes in filename (e.g., `01-21-2025.md`)
- Do NOT include course code or date in file content headers
- Raw notes files: `raw-[date].md`
- Cleaned notes files: `pretty-[date].md`

## Note Processing Guidelines
When generating cleaned-up notes from raw notes:

### Only populate sections if explicitly mentioned:
- **Questions & Things to Look Up**: Only include if user explicitly noted questions or things to look up in raw notes
- **Important Definitions**: Only include if user explicitly noted definitions in raw notes
- **Review Questions**: Only include if user explicitly mentioned questions/problems in raw notes

### Do NOT generate:
- Questions or things to look up unless explicitly noted
- Definitions unless explicitly noted
- Do not make assumptions about what the user should look up or define

### Always include (but populate based on content):
- Key Concepts: Extract main ideas from raw notes
- TODOs: Extract any tasks or reminders from raw notes
- Summary: Create a clean summary of the lecture
- Connections & Big Picture: Add context and connections when possible

## Creating New Notes
- Use the `new-note.sh` script to create new raw note files
- Usage: `./new-note.sh [course_code]` or `new note [course_code]`
- Example: `./new-note.sh 381` creates `cecs381/raw-MM-DD-YYYY.md` with today's date
- The script automatically creates the course directory if it doesn't exist
- If the file already exists, it will open the existing file instead

## Workflow
1. Create new raw note file using `new-note.sh` script (e.g., `new note 381`)
2. User takes messy notes in `raw-[date].md` files during lectures
3. Generate `pretty-[date].md` files using the template structure from `template.md`
4. Clean up and organize content from raw notes
5. Only populate sections that user explicitly mentioned in raw notes
6. Preserve the raw notes content (if template includes raw notes section)
