Generating permutations (recursive / decrease-and-conquer)

Goal: list all orderings (permutations) of a set S.

Idea:
- Pick one element x to be the first element (the "head")
- Recursively generate all permutations of the remaining elements: S - {x}
- Prefix x onto each of those results
- Repeat for every possible choice of x

Example: S = {A, B, C}
- Fix A: permute {B, C} -> BC, CB -> ABC, ACB
- Fix B: permute {A, C} -> AC, CA -> BAC, BCA
- Fix C: permute {A, B} -> AB, BA -> CAB, CBA


connection: its just backtracking
its just like leetcode
basisclaly y ou take current task, then perform recursin on the remaining options
then backtrack (pop off)
then try the other path


def generate_permutations(elements):
    # wrapper function
    # elements: [list]
    # hm im thinking that you have to take in the index too tho - oh you define it in backtrack
    results = []
    def backtrack(current_path, remaining_options):
        if len(remaining_options) == 0:
            # no more optiosn to pick up on
            results.append(current_path.copy())
            return

        # my personal attempt basedon what he has
        # for e in remaining_options:
        #     current_path.append(e)
        #     remaining_options.remove(e)
        #     backtrack(current_path,remaining_options)
        #     current_path.pop()
        #     remaining_options.add(e)
        # conceptually that was right but remaining optiosn shouldnt be mutatd like that
    
        for i in range(len(remaining_options)):
            item = remaining_options[i]
            # new path
            current_path.append(item)
            backtrack(current_path, remaining_options[:i] + remaining_options[i+1:])
            current_path.pop()
    
    backtrack([], elements)
            
    return results
i dont like htis remainig options method irathe rjust do the index way 

what is the indesx way then 
well you add the current indexs to ur path 
then call dfs with i+1
then remove from ur path?
nooo wait 
you have to keep track of used becaue it should b
 able to be in any orer
 if i did it with moving the i, i would get substs not permutatinos
 ^ do a lc on this or something
