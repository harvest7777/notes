## Key Concepts

- **Randomness applications**: Needed for security (cryptography), recommendation systems, AI systems (temperature parameter), and scientific applications (DNA)
- **Combinatorics**: Permutations and combinations for counting arrangements and selections
- **Birthday problem**: Probability calculation using complement rule (subtract probabilities that opposite happens)

## TODOs

- Send resume for paid RA position ($15/hr, 20 hr/week) - would be good for summer

## Summary

Syllabus day introduction to CECS381. Covered why randomness is important across various domains (security, AI, science). Worked through combinatorics problems including permutations, combinations, and the birthday problem. Discussed research assistant opportunity.

## Review Questions

1. How many ways can you arrange ABC in a row? (Answer: 3×2×1 = 6 ways)
2. From 5 students, how many ways can you pick 2 students to form a study pair? (Answer: C(5,2) = 10)
3. If you have 4 seniors and 3 juniors, how many teams can you form with exactly 2 seniors and 1 junior? (Answer: C(4,2) × C(3,1) = 6 × 3 = 18)
4. In a row of 23 people, what is the probability that 2 people have the same birthday? (Hint: use complement rule - subtract probabilities that opposite happens)
