BIG IDEA
probability is engine for 3 things
- uncertainty management (ai sensors, networks)
- algorithm design (randomization makes things faster)
- systen analystis (will mys erver crash?)

naive probabiliyt
p(e) = size of event e / size of sample space omega
hard part is finding out size of omega
calculating omega is counting problem, if its large we need combinatorics

sum rule for or
productrule fo rsequential step like you must do step 1 first thens tep 2 (and)
step 1 done in n1 ways, satep 2 done in n2 ways, totals is n1 x n2

combinatorial explosion - way too many chocies so brute force doesnt worimage.png

stuff i need to study and have qwuestions about
when selecting samples, im not sure the difference in how we handle if ordering matters or if replacement is allowed 

DO PRAC PROBLEM ON ORDER + REPLACEMENt
super important shit
order + replacement allwoed -> TUPLES
in bits replacement is allwoed bc you can have a 1 in one slot then 1 agan in another slot
in that case, we jut use product rule and multiply together
n^k where n is choice of slot sk is the length of the list

let me guess: if it snot allowed you do factorial
order + NO replacement -> PERMUTATIONS
"how many ways are there to shuffle aroudn 1 2 3"
like guesserate permutations on lc
ezpz
ex: arrange 1st 2nd 3rd place for students a b c d e
5 * 4 * 3 = 60 ways 

p(n,k) = n!/(n-k)!
n - = is the facotrial of what we didnt select

1 digit 3 letters 3 digits
10 + 26 * 26 * 26 + 10 * 10 * 10 ?
 i think we add it because i am thinking the format is not movable, so fi multiply that would be saying its movable

 NO IM WRONG
 you multipoly not add, my assumption is incorrect. adding is saying you can pick from 1 digit 3 letters or 3 digits. multiplying is saying "and then" you need the other.
 so it's 

10 * 26 * 26 * 26 * 10 * 10 * 10 ?
